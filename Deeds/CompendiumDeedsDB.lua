This book tells the tale of one such Maiden caught in unexpected battle, who in striving to defend her Lord against a great onslaught, sang out in clearest tones a stirring song of war as she fought. Such was the power of her voice that even the Orcs whom she faced saw her not as a frail woman, but as a great warrior to be feared.Alas, you have no idea how the story ends and several other details beside seem to be missing from this copy of the book, which has been damaged by time and neglect.

The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.Lore of the Blade seems to be a rather unusual tome for a Lore-master to express interest in. Rather than delving deeply into the hidden mysteries of mountains, or discussing at length the habits of wave and wind, it reads more like a rousing tale of adventure written to entertain hobbit-children. The pages of Lore of the Blade claim to follow the adventures of a brave young Lore-master who when confronted with deadly dangers is just as apt to fight her way through with flashing swordplay as to confound her opponents with the lore of the elements or the wisdom of long forgotten sages. Oddly, as you find yourself drawn into the stirring tale you begin to see the more subtle nuances of the story unfold through the eyes of its character, who displays an uncanny insight into the nature of the foes she faces, and an understanding of when the strength of arms applied at the correct moment may indeed be the least destructive course.Unfortunately, some prior reader has handled this copy rather poorly and some of the pages are torn beyond repair.

You cannot recognize the type of parchment it was written upon, nor what kind of ink could withstand the passage of so much time without fading. The main indication of its age and origin is the writing style which is in an extremely old form using ancient letters called Tengwar, which were created by the Noldor many ages ago. The main focus of the book is difficult to translate, but seems to centre around an ancient oath of battle that Elf-guardians might make in the midst of a desperate melee, in essence binding themselves and their enemies in a pact of battle and death that neither the oath-taker nor their sworn-enemies dared break.It is clear from the text that these oaths carried power beyond that of any simple cry to infuriate or trick one's enemies -- but the secret of the technique seems lost as several key pages have been carefully cut from the book, presumably by someone hoping to safeguard its secrets in an age long past.

It is no simple treatise on the art of battle, as so many texts are.
